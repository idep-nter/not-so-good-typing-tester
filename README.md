*Doesn't include proper texts for testing*

I tried to make a simple typing tester which wasns't as good idea as I initially thought - I have met several difficulties during writing it and the result simply isn't that good.

Apart from problems from trying a new editor the biggest one was that user could get simply lost in longer texts and the program would incorrectly count errors after that so I decided to split text into sentences so the user could see only one at the time and the program could count errors in each one by one. - the amount of time this solution took me was so embarasing that I thought for a moment I'm gonna ditch it and do something else. But I made it, hurray.

I might make some proper version of this in the distant future so this cursed thing might be forgotten.

Here is how it works:
User chooses difficulty and exact text and when he's ready each sentence is printed as he tries to write it as soon as possible with least errors as possible.
At the end it simply evaluates his performance by calculatin his wpm and accuracy.
